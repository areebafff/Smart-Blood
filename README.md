# Smart-Blood
1.1 Purpose
Smart Blood is a software aimed towards the healthcare industry to help patients and
donors under one application. Patients will be able to evaluate their blood test reports and
donors will have a platform that would allow them to complete donor related tasks.
1.2 Document Conventions
This document is following IEEE format. The format of the headings is as follows: Major
headings are in bold 18pt font, and concurrent headings in bold 14 pt font. Sections are in the
format of x.y, where x and y are real, positive integers.

1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
As the software requirement specification (SRS) is written for a more general audience, this
document is intended for individuals directly involved in the development of Smart Blood. This
includes medical facility staff (management, information technology, quality, validation, and
laboratory), auditors, software developers, project consultants, and team managers, as well
as testers such as Doctors, Patients, Donors and Staff. This document need not be read
sequentially, users are encouraged to jump to any section they find relevant. Anyone can use
Smart Blood to donate as well as who need blood, i.e patients, hospitals, blood banks, etc.
1.4 Product Scope
This software will enable patients to understand their test reports and based on their
reports they will be recommended with medicines that could potentially treat them. The
blood reports our application will be able to evaluate are vitamins, iron, complete blood
count and the basic metabolic panel.Donors will be able to make an account, book
appointments, view their donor history etc. Doctors can have a benefit as the evaluation
process has been decreased, doctors will be able to just take the reports and all the
medicines/treatments will be listed.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The software will be able to check the patient’s blood test report, analyze it, and then it will
suggest whether the patient needs Blood or he/she can be cured by Medicines. It can be
primarily used by patients, doctors, and blood banks. It is a modified version of Smart Blood
Analytics where we can only get an analysis of our blood report, and you have to figure on

your own what step you will take next, but in our software, the experts will guide you about
your condition and it will help you to save your money.
